    <h1>How To Use Android Application</h1>

    <h2 id="send-link">Send a Link</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Lets try to send a link from Android browser. Start a browser application on your phone and open some page in it,
            e.g. <a href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a>. Click on Menu and search for "Share page" option.
            After you select it, you will see a "Share via" dialog with a list of applications you want to share with.
            Find and select a SyncTab option here. </p>

        <div class="docImage">
            <img src="{% get_static_prefix %}image/docs/share-via.png" alt="Share Via" height="200"/>
            <div class="label">Send link via SyncTab</div>
        </div>

        <p>After you select a SyncTab option, you will see a new screen from SyncTab application.
            Here you will see a dialog box called "Send To..." with a few tags.
            You can send a link with specified tag only. Such you limit what devices and browsers
            can receive and open link. For example, you can send a link to Home browser, or to Android tablet.</p>

        <div class="docImage">
            <img src="{% get_static_prefix %}image/docs/send-to.png" alt="Shared Link" height="240"/>
            <div class="label">Send To</div>
        </div>

        <p>Then you will see a message that a tab is syncing. Wait for a few seconds.
            If you have an Internet connection up, you will see a next message:</p>

        <div class="docImage">
            <img src="{% get_static_prefix %}image/docs/link-shared.png" alt="Shared Link" height="240"/>
            <div class="label">Shared Link</div>
        </div>

        <p>Now the link is shared. And as soon as you'll have a connection to the internet, it will be available in your desktop browser.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="view-sent-links">View List of Sent Links</h2>
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Start SyncTab application. Login if need. You should be on Home page now. Home page contains a list of already shared links.
            When you connected to the internet, you may load the entire list of shared links.</p>
